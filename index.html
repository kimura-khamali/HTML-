    <h3>Warm Welcoming </h3>
    <p>On the 27th of January,2024,I was warmly welcomed by the Aluminis as they offered to be of assitant <br>to both my parent and
         I.I was able to meet up with new students on the same day and know <br>the area around, that was to be  a home for the next 10 months to come.
        The calmness of the place truly brought out the nature of serious pf the place.</p>

       <p>Through the speech we were given.I realised their was much to be covered through the program and it required one to be focused. </p>
    
       <h3>The Good Times</h3>
       <p>As the days are progressing i learn alot each day.Realizing that days can be engaging since we not only remain on our comfort but challanged.
          Not giving up is important,but excellence inwhat one does is key. <br> <br>

          <span><b>Good Experiences </b></span>
          <ol>
            <li>There is a supportive community thats always willing to give a hand when yuo express that you require assitant</li>
            <li>Its an interactive community since one can make friends and learn from each other</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that one acquires a mentor especially an alumini of Akirachix so you can learn from one another</li>
            <li>Not forgetting the amazing meals that always keeps one in toes since they are also part of the encouragement.</li>
            <li>Assignments given are inteructive since it helps me gauge myself on my improvement.</li>
            <li>Aside from the classroom side i feel am also learning from the environment side since i have to ensure 
                all my area of work, rooms is clean before going to class which i believe i will adapt even after here</li>
          </ol>

       </p>

       <h3>The Bad Moments</h3>
       <p>So far some moments are not easily notable since even if its expressed that way.The negative experience become worth it.</p><br> <br>
       <span><b>Bad Experience</b></span>
       <ul>
        <li>As it was only the first week some of as felt it worth to wake up early forgetting their some days that we will need to do that.</li>
       <li>Having trouble with the staffs due to issues that we are meant to be able to give athought and solve them on our own.</li>

       </ul>

       <p>Overall, I would want to work my best and challange myself more.<br> To acquire success as previous cohort</p>
